      From countless hours Sonya spent jumping off the dock during her summers at Birch Island, to Patricia recording her sense of humour on an old job application, the Shades of Our Sisters Exhibition explores stories and artifacts of who these women were and what the loss of their lives meant to their loved ones.

      <br><br>From <a ng-href='contact_blurb_link1'>Friday, February 17th to Sunday, February 19th</a> at the Tecumseh Auditorium in Toronto, Ontario, we encourage you to come and view two short documentary features and two installation pieces that tell the stories of Sonya Cywink, and Patricia Carpenter. We will also be traveling this exhibition to the Alderville Community Centre in Alderville, Ontario from <a ng-href='contact_blurb_link2'>Tuesday, February 21st to Wednesday, February 22nd</a> and to Espanola High School in Espanola, Ontario from <a ng-href='contact_blurb_link2'>Friday, February 24th to Saturday, February 25th</a>. Click on the links to find out more.

      <br><br>As well, this page will be updated with links and resources on how you can prevent violence in your communities, and promote a safe environment. For a more extensive list, please check our <a ng-href='contact_blurb_link4'>blog</a>. In the meantime, if you have further questions, please feel free to contact us at <a ng-href='email'>info@shadesofoursisters.com</a>. Miigwetch.
